# coolworkdayscheduler

This is my submission for Work Day Scheduler Module 5 Challenge. 
Students were required to download starter code and add to it in order to meet required criteria. 
This is code for a work day scheduler that allows users to enter text into time slots and save the entries into local storage for another time. 
Current time is displayed in red on the time slot. The Future is highlighted Green and the Past is Grey.
